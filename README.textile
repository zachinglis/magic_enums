h1. MagicEnums

h2. Introduction

*RAILS 2.1/EDGE only!*

A nice way to have enums in Rails.

Enumerations are easy as integers, however I want to take a text approach to it as soon as rearranging integers can get fussy.

h2. Usage

h3. In your models

<pre>
  <code>
    enum_column :status, %w(draft private published)    
  </code>
</pre>
_or_
<pre>
  <code>
    enum_column :gender, ['male', 'female']
  </code>
</pre>

h3. In your controller

In your controller, you can check the status <code>post_record.status_is_published?</code> or simply by calling <code>person_record.gender</code> to find it out in words, as you would normally.

You can also do find calls like so:
<pre>
  <code>
    Post.status_is_published
  </code>
</pre>
_or_
<pre>
  <code>
    Person.gender_is_male
  </code>
</pre>
