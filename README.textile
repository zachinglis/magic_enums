h1. MagicEnums

h2. Introduction

A nice way to have enums in Rails.

Enumerations are easy as integers, however I want to take a text approach to it as soon as rearranging integers can get fussy.

h2. Usage

<pre>
  <code>
    enum_column :status, %w(draft private published)    
  </code>
</pre>
_or_
<pre>
  <code>
    enum_column :gender, ['draft', 'private', 'published']
  </code>
</pre>
